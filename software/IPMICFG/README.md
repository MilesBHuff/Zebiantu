Download the latest version of IPMICFG for your system [here](https://www.supermicro.com/en/support/resources/downloadcenter/smsdownload).
Extract the files.
Copy/paste the right binary for your system to somewhere on your PATH.
Mark it as executable.
That's it!

I wish there were some way to automatically download and install new updates. Alas that proprietary software is so annoying.
